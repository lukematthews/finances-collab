Prompts.

For this data model, create a React app that manages budgets. All of the editing is live and data changes are emitted via WebSockets. Redux should be used for a centralised state.

A budget has a name.
A budget has many months.

A month:
- Has a name.
- Has many accounts.
- Has many transactions.
- Is either started or not started.
- Has a starting balance (currency)
- Has a closing balance (currency)
- Is ordered by position

An Account:
- Has a name
- Has a balance (currency)

A Transaction:
- Has a description
- Has a date
- Has an amount (currency)
- Is paid or not paid

Pages:
  Home page:
  - Displays the available budgets as cards. Each budget card has a button to open the budget
  Budget:
  - Has the name of the budget and the currently selected month as a heading
  - Has a tab control for selecting a month. The tab control will be a medium size
  
The content of the month tab is:
  MonthDetails
    - The starting balance: A read only input formatted as AUD.
    - The closing balance: A read only input formatted as AUD.
    - A slider indicating whether or not the month is started.
  Accounts
    The list of accounts for the month. The user will be able to add and delete accounts.
    - An account should have a name input and a balance input. Any changes to these values should be debounced and emit a message to the server when modified
  Transactions
    The list of transactions for the month. The user will be able to add and delete transactions.
    Transactions are sorted automatically by date and then value descending

Starting and closing balances.
The rules for calculating the starting balance are:
- If the month is started, the starting balance is the sum of the account balances.
- If the month is not started, it is the closing balance of the previous month.
The rules for closing balance are:
- It is the starting balance plus the total of all the unpaid transactions for the month.

- The site should have URL routing.
"/" is the home page. The user will be presented with the available budgets.
"/:budget" is the page for the budget. The the month with the highest position is shown by default
"/:budget/:monthName" selects the tab for that month.



When do the month balances change?
- Transaction added / deleted. That month and future months.
- Transaction marked as paid. That month and future months.
- Transaction amount changed. That month and future months.
- Account added. That month and future months.
- Account deleted. That month and future months.
- Account balance changed. That month and future months.

Starting and closing balances should be stored against the month in state.
